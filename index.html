    It's getting too late
    Time to create
    Separate the weight
    Pulling you down
    Like doubt and hate
    We're surrounded by sounds of the snakes
    Got another hundred thousand to make
    I ain't talkin' bout money
    I'm talking mistakes
    Made my momma cry
    That's enough for the day
    Take me out in your mouth if you've got something to say
    I think it's a shame
    If you ain't livin' a life like mine
    I understand why you don't understand
    I'm fine, I'm doing 9 out of 10
    I ain't losing none, cause I am the one
    I am the one, I am the one, I am
    
    CHORUS:
    Calling anybody out there
    I think I really need some help
    I really need some help, nah
    I'm the only one in here
    So I only need myself
    I only need myself
    You don't know that my soul is missing
    This is my solo mission
    This is my solo mission
    This is my solo mission
    You don't know that my soul went missing
    This is my solo mission
    This is my solo mission
    Your rhymes won't make it in time
    Even if you sniff some solvent and you thought that you were super sonic
    I saw all of it, yet I couldn't solve it
    Ain't talkin' like you shouldn't bother
    Reach the farthest just so somebody could go farther
    If all the fish in the sea turned into another Pearl Harbor
    All the sons left will turn to fathers
    Some sons learn only sunburns
    Cause we got no one to look up to but the sun

    You know they out to hunt you
    Tomorrow is today
    Today is gone tomorrow

This is my solo mission

Ya want somethin' to talk about
Nature's poisoned by plastic
Quit class to make classics
Tell 'em I was studying
Now I'm dropping out
Don't give a what but I love you
Brace yourself for impact there
Cause nobody to run to
Go to sleep
Your demons out to haunt you
Wake up
You know they out to hunt you
Tomorrow is today
Today is gone tomorrow
What you gonna do?
Imma take that time I borrowed
Then I'd spend it all on you
I'd spend it all
I'd spend it all
I'd spend it all
On you
It's getting too late
Time to create
Separate the weight
Pulling you down
Like doubt and hate
We're surrounded by sounds of the snakes
Got another hundred thousand to make
I ain't talkin' bout money
I'm talking mistakes
Made my momma cry
That's enough for the day
Take me out in your mouth if you've got something to say
I think it's a shame
If you ain't livin' a life like mine
I understand why you don't understand
I'm fine, I'm doing 9 out of 10
I ain't losing none, cause I am the one
I am the one, I am the one, I am

CHORUS:
Calling anybody out there
I think I really need some help
I really need some help, nah
I'm the only one in here
So I only need myself
I only need myself
You don't know that my soul is missing
This is my solo mission
This is my solo mission
This is my solo mission
You don't know that my soul went missing
This is my solo mission
This is my solo mission
Your rhymes won't make it in time
Even if you sniff some solvent and you thought that you were super sonic
I saw all of it, yet I couldn't solve it
Ain't talkin' like you shouldn't bother
Reach the farthest just so somebody could go farther
If all the fish in the sea turned into another Pearl Harbor
All the sons left will turn to fathers
Some sons learn only sunburns
Cause we got no one to look up to but the sun

CHORUS:
Calling anybody out there
I think I really need some help
I really need some help, nah
I'm the only one in here
So I only need myself
I only need myself
You don't know that my soul went missing
This is my solo mission
This is my solo mission
This is my solo mission
You don't know that my soul went missing
This is my solo mission
This is my solo mission

Ya want somethin' to talk about

Brace yourself for impact there
Cause nobody to run to
Go to sleep
Your demons out to haunt you
Wake up
You know they out to hunt you
Tomorrow is today
Today is gone tomorrow
What you gonna do?
Imma take that time I borrowed
Then I'd spend it all on you
I'd spend it all
I'd spend it all
I'd spend it all
On you
